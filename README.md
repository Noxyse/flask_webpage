# Webpage creation

## What can be found in this repo
- Backend: PYTHON programming (introduction to logical structures)
- Sanitization and validation of a form
- Honeypot antispam feature

## Performance criteria:
- If the user makes an error, the form should be returned to them with valid responses preserved in their respective input fields.
- Ideally, display error messages near their respective fields.
- The form will perform server-side sanitization and validation.
- If sanitization and validation are successful, a "Thank you for contacting us." page will be displayed, summarizing all the encoded information.
